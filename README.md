# End-to-End License Plate Recognition and Barrier Control System

## Project Overview
The **End-to-End License Plate Recognition and Barrier Control System** is an intelligent solution that integrates vehicle identity recognition, access control, and data management. Based on deep learning and computer vision technologies, this system constructs a full-process closed-loop architecture from license plate image acquisition, real-time recognition to barrier linkage control. It supports precise license plate recognition in complex environments across multiple scenarios and can quickly handle challenging conditions such as strong light, heavy rain, and damaged license plates.

## Core Features
- **Millisecond-level License Plate Feature Extraction**: Rapid and accurate extraction of license plate features to ensure smooth vehicle passage.
- **Dynamic Threshold Barrier Trigger Mechanism**: Intelligent control of barrier operations based on dynamic thresholds to adapt to varying traffic conditions.
- **High Reliability and Flexible Scalability**: The system is designed to be highly reliable and easily scalable to fit different hardware configurations, supporting a wide range of application scenarios.

## Application Scenarios
- **Parking Lots**: Automate vehicle access control to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.
- **Industrial Parks**: Enhance security and streamline vehicle management within the park.
- **Highway Toll Gates**: Accelerate traffic flow and improve the overall efficiency of highway toll systems.

## Technology Stack
- **PaddleOCR**: Utilized for license plate detection and recognition, leveraging its powerful OCR capabilities to achieve high-precision text extraction.
- **PaddleDetection**: Employed for object detection tasks, enabling the system to accurately locate license plates in various image conditions.

## System Architecture
1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture license plate images using high-resolution cameras.
2. **Real-Time Recognition**: Process captured images through PaddleOCR to extract license plate information in real-time.
3. **Barrier Control**: Trigger barrier operations based on recognition results and dynamic threshold settings.
4. **Data Management**: Store and manage recognition data, supporting API integration for further analysis and monitoring.
